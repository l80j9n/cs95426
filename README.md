Frame. research question, variables and method 1. What is your research question? Include independent variables, dependent variables and method in title.
How does varying the concentration of copper ions (Cu²⁺) in the electrolyte solution affect the rate of electrolysis by using copper electrode and graphite electrode and measuring the mass added on the graphite electrode?  2. What is your independent variable? (What are you changing? How will you change it?) (1) the concentration of the copper ions in the electrolyte solution  4. What is your dependent variable? (What are you measuring? How will you measure it?) (1) The mass change on the graphite electrode (2) The temperature increases of the electrolyte 3. What range will you choose for your independent variable? 
Your range should aim to be at least 5. For instance, 5 sites to measure pH, 5 different soil samples, 5 different types of water. If you can be specific, list your range here. 
5 different copper ion concentration in the electrolyte concentration including 1M, 0.5M, 0,25M, 0.125M, 0.0625M 5. How will you measure your dependent variable? 
What equipment will you use? Is it possible to do repeats of this method? For instance – will you do a titration? (1) Electronic weighing equipment (2) Dryer (3) Thermometer 6. Control Variables 
What are going to try and keep the same? Why is it going to be important? How will you keep it the same?  Variable Why is it important? How will you control it? 
Voltage  
It provides more energy, overcomes overpotential, accelerates diffusion of re代 写IA Planning Sheet – ChemistryC/C++

Temperature 
The temperature will change the kinetic energy of molecules, increase the speed of ion movement and the reaction constant K, decrease the resistance and provide sufficient energy for overpotential. 

Concentration and volume of sulfuric acid in the electrolyte 

The conductivity is influenced by the concentration of H⁺ and SO₄²⁻ which will affect the speed of copper ion movement.  

Brand of the copper electrode and graphite electrode 


The surface area of graphite electrode  


The distance between the copper electrode and graphite electrode 

7. Apparatus
